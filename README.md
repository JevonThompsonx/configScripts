My setup for debian distro to make my life easy

## Extra setup 

Some of these will need some extra setup although I've tried to make it as easy as possible for myself. Here's the stuff that I am keeping track of so far that will need some setup 

1. gnome calendar - add nextcloud calendars
2. neovim - run `:Lazysync` to update
3. The desktop environment - currently running xfce
4. add web apps to web app manager
  - proton mail
  - chatgpt
  - gemini
  - claude
  - deepseek
